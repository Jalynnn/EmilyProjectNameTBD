Python code for receiving WebSocket Messages &amp; Sending LSL Events!

# Anaconda Activate "WebSocketServer"

Video available on how to use with Postman

# LSL-Bridge

Completion:
Goal 1: Start of a disaster (resolution_status = in_progress)
Goal 2: End of a disaster (resolution_status = resolved)
Goal 3: Which resources moved by which participants

In Progress:
Goal 4: Start of a round
Goal 5: End of a round

Additional Goals:
Error Correction - Random JSON's should no longer disconnect the connection
However, I want to test all JSON options to confirm that disconnection and errors are no longer feasible!

# Correction to the current video:

I mentioned that the deploymentEvent may be referring to the received but the code was actually correct in that we care about the deploymentEvent for when resources were sent!
