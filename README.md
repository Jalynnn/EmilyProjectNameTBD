Goal 2: End of a disaster (resolution_status = resolved)
Goal 3: Which resources moved by which participants
Goal 4: Start of a round
Goal 5: End of a round

Additional Completions:
Error Correction - Random JSON's should no longer disconnect the connection

# Correction to the WebSocketServerWithPostman video:

I mentioned that the deploymentEvent may be referring to the received but the code was actually correct in that we care about the deploymentEvent for when resources were sent!
